# ABCoder: AI-Based Coder(AKA: A Brand-new Coder)

![ABCoder](images/ABCoder.png)

# Overview
ABCoder, an AI-oriented Code-processing **Framework**, is designed to enhance and extend the coding context for Large-Language-Model (LLM), finally boosting the development of AI-assisted-programming applications. 


## Features

- Universal Abstract-Syntax-Tree (UniAST), a language-independent, AI-friendly specification of code information, providing a boundless, flexible and structural coding context for both AI and humans.
  
- General Parser, parses arbitrary-language codes to UniAST.

- General Writer transforms UniAST back to code.

- **Code-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (Code-RAG)**, provides a set of MCP tools to help the LLM understand code repositories precisely and locally. And it can support both in-workspace and out-of-workspace third-party libraries simultaneously -- I guess you are thinking about [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.org) and [context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7), but ABCoder is more reliable and confidential -- no need to wait for their services to be done, and no worry about your codes will be uploaded! 

Based on these features, developers can easily implement or enhance their AI-assisted programming applications, such as reviewing, optimizing, translating, etc.

# Quick Start
## Use ABCoder as a MCP server

1. Install ABCoder:

    ```bash
    go install github.com/cloudwego/abcoder@latest
    ```

2. Use ABCoder to parse a repository to UniAST (JSON)

    ```bash
    abcoder parse {language} {repo-path} > xxx.json
    ```

    For example, to parse a Go repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cloudwego/localsession.git localsession
    abcoder parse go localsession -o /abcoder-asts/localsession.json
    ```

    To parse repositories in other languages, [install the corresponding language server first](./docs/lsp-installation-en.md).

3. Integrate ABCoder's MCP tools into your AI agent.

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "abcoder": {
                "command": "abcoder",
                "args": [
                    "mcp",
                    "{the-AST-directory}"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```


4. Enjoy it!

## Tips:
    
- You can add more repo ASTs into the AST directory without restarting abcoder MCP server.
    
- Try to use [the recommened prompt](llm/prompt/analyzer.md) and combine planning/memory tools like [sequential-thinking](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) in your AI agent.


## Use ABCoder as an Agent (WIP)

You can also use ABCoder as a command-line Agent like:

```bash
export API_TYPE='{openai|ollama|ark|claude}' 
export API_KEY='{your-api-key}' 
export MODEL_NAME='{model-endpoint}' 
abcoder agent {the-AST-directory}
```
For example:

```bash
$ API_TYPE='ark' API_KEY='xxx' MODEL_NAME='zzz' abcoder agent ./testdata/asts

Hello! I'm ABCoder, your coding assistant. What can I do for you today?

$ What does the repo 'localsession' do?

The `localsession` repository appears to be a Go module (`github.com/cloudwego/localsession`) that provides functionality related to managing local sessions. Here's a breakdown of its structure and purpose:
...
If you'd like to explore specific functionalities or code details, let me know, and I can dive deeper into the relevant files or nodes. For example:
- What does `session.go` or `manager.go` implement?
- How is the backup functionality used?

$ exit
```

- NOTICE: This feature is Work-In-Progress. It only supports code analysis at present.
